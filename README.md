#### The Master ( or Root ) namespace is '::lus' (my lastname's 3 first letters) for the inner class and object names to prevent name clashing with other APIs having the same names.
### List of main component and classes:

---
<h5>lus::string</h5> 
- Basic string goodies because I am lazy.
---
 - <h5>lus::ui::color * </h5> colors and colors db support for truecolors consoles.

Lots more to come....
